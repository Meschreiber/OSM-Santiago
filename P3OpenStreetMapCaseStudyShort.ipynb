Though I know this is a street, there are other incidents where an actualy place name could be used instead of a street.  To take advantage of the name_street_fix function, I opt to change the key to `name` and allow `name_street_fix` to then change into into 'addr:street'.  Though this seems like a roundabout path, it is better to use in case a non-numerical, non-street name name is accidentally put as a value for `addr:interpolation`.

Runners-up are other comunas with high numbers of restaurants, schools, residential areas, etc.  We can see that this is another area for improvement since there are some redundancies, e.g. the comuna of Providencia is represented in 6 different ways: 'Providencia', 'Providencia,Santiago', 'Santiago;Providencia', 'Providencia;Santiago', 'Providencia;Santiago', 'Providencias'.  Additionally, while initially scanning the data, I noticed that some had opted to use the \"is_in\" tag to denote a part of the city, furthermore pointing out a need for standardizing the data."

Scraping from government websites as well as commerical sites like Tripadvisor would augment the information on schools and amenities and help to audit its consistency.  There does already seem to be a large amount of data already present on public transportation, however.  This makes sense as the largest source of data is http://www.transantiago.cl.  Sometimes it seems there was duplicated or errneous data for public transport though, as an SQL query showed 144 metro stations, though there are only 108.  (Footnote #5).  \n",

    "### Benefits of increased completeness and consistency through scraping additional sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Though currently most query results matched with my perceptions about the city (e.g. where banks and restaurants are located) this is perhaps because my personal biased view is shared by those those who input the data, who possibly live in simililar (and relatively affluent) parts of the city.  Thus the data is weighted towards them.  Scraping from multiple sources will create a more accurate map of the city and as a result, queries will yield more accurate results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scraping from multiple sources to increase completeness will also create more uniformity issues. Uniformity is already a big issue for this data set, not just in terms of abbreviations for street names, but how items are tagged.  Sometimes street names are duplicated in multiple tags and many versions of the comunas (regions of the city) cloud the data.  Re-tagging the \"city\" and \"is-in\" for uniformity is one extension on the wrangling that has been done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study attempted to make street abbreviations uniform and change the keys for improper secondary tags (from addr:interpolation to addr:street, for example).  Additionally, querying was used to learn about the number of users, which amenities are present in the data, and where they can be found across the city.  Currently, this map is missing a lot of data. Remaining questions include what the meaning of the \"id_origin\" tag is and what the numerical codes for the school operator tag mean.  In general, I wonder if there is a way to name these tags or whether files/forums exist on OpenStreetMaps that makes these things more transparent.\n"
